Bliss (A Full Stack Web Application):
Tech Used:  React, JavaScript, Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS etc.

Bliss is a social media app where people can share pictures, texts, and memes with each other and make friends. It uses different technologies like React, JavaScript, Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to make the app work properly.

To protect users' passwords, the app uses a technique called "hashing" with a special tool called "Bcrypt". This makes sure that passwords are kept safe.

The app is designed to work on different devices, including small screens. It uses React components and Tailwind CSS to make sure the app looks good and works well no matter what device is used.

The app has a lot of features like Login, Logout, Like, Follow, Unfollow, etc. All of these features are made possible by building a REST API with Node and Express. The API makes it possible to create, read, update, and delete information like user data, posts, and images.

Finally, all the information is stored in a database called MongoDB. This is where all the user's data is saved, so they can access it whenever they want.

Note : - 
Certainly! It's important to note that  there are many issues or bugs with the app,nd  it's always possible to work on fixing them. One way to do this is by debugging the code and testing the app thoroughly. This app also crashes a lot.
